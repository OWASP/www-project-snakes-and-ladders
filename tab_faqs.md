## FAQs

### Why Snakes & Ladders?
The OWASP Top 10 is the most well known document, but OWASP has many other resources which provide better approaches for secure application development. In particular, there are some "top 10 controls" lists, and I wanted to highlight those. Creating a board game that features both risks and controls is a simple way to compare and contrast these aspects.

Players do not need to know either the risks or controls on the lists, since they are just the decoration to what is otherwise standard Snakes & Ladders. But as players land on assigned squares, this can be used to discuss the risks and controls they are labelled with.

Also, after undertaking some due diligence, it was noted that since Snakes & Ladders is such an ancient game it is not anyone's intellectual property and many others have already created thousands of different designs and versions. Other games would not meet this requirement.

### How was the game created?
By hard work! Each list of risks and controls contains ten items, so the rough layout of snakes and ladder starting and end points was sketched out on paper, as shown for web applications on the right. Instructional text was written.

The concept was then converted into a layered Adobe Illustrator file, and the text and graphics added. This design went through a number of iterations to ensure it was legible and appealing. The PDF was exported and both the PDF and AI files added to the project page. When translations were provided, these were added as separate text layers in the source Illustrator file, and then new files uploaded again to the project.

Once Web Applications Snakes & Ladders was complete, the file was duplicated and edited for Mobile Apps. This has different risks, controls and arrangement of snakes and ladders. It also has its own colour scheme.

### How can I participate in your project?
All you have to do is make the Project Leader aware of your available time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the Leader know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the project meet its goals and milestones. There are many different ways you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads is key. Please see the road map and getting involved section

### If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?
Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are looking for users, translators and people to promote the project.

## How to Play

Snakes and Ladders is a popular board game, with ancient provenance imported into Great Britain from Asia in the 19th century. The original game showed the effects of good and evil, or virtues and vices. This OWASP game is a poster-sized print-your-own paper sheet with the game board on it. Just get some players together with a die and counters. The virtues are application security controls, and the vices are risks.

* The game is for 2-6 players.
* Firstly print the sheet out, get a six-sided die and some counters (markers).
* Give each player a coloured counter (marker). To begin, each player should throw the die to determine who plays first; the highest can lead.
* Put all the players' counters onto the first square labelled “Start 1”.
* In turn, each player rolls the die and moves their counter by the number of squares indicated on the die. At the end of the move, if a player’s counter is at the bottom end of a ladder, the counter must be moved up the ladder to the square at its higher end. Conversely, if the player’s counter is located at the mouth of a snake, the counter must be moved down to the end of the snake’s tail.
* As a better alternative to enhance learning, either require the participants to discuss the risk/control when a player reaches each square, or only allow players to climb up a ladder after a quest about the control (e.g. simply describing the control, explain the risk (one example) the named control addresses and how the control (one example) could help prevent the named it
* The first player to reach “100” at the top left wins. Give a prize.
